## Problem:
* **Challenge:** In this modern world there are many kinds of diseases therefore making disease analysis more challenging. Doctors have to look in massive data sets to figure out what's the patient disease is therefore massively slowing the medication process.

* **Solution:** Machine learning will analyze the massive data sets and will show diseases that are related to the given data therefore helping doctors analyze the patients disease

## Type of Machine Learning Used:
* **Supervised Learning:** Models are trained on labeled datasets where the outcome (e.g., presence of a disease) is known.

## Impact:
* **Improved Diagnosis** Machine learning in healthcare can be used by medical professionals to develop better diagnostic tools to analyze medical images. This type of machine learning algorithm could potentially help doctors make quicker, more accurate diagnoses leading to improved patient outcomes.

* **Reduce Cost** Machine learning technologies can be used by healthcare organizations to improve the efficiency of healthcare, which could lead to cost savings.
* **Improved Accuracy:** Increased accuracy in disease detection, allowing for earlier and more effective treatment.
* **Patient Outcomes:** Better patient outcomes due to early intervention and personalized treatment plans.

# Finance - Fraud Detection

## Problem:
* **Challenge:** Identify and prevent fraudulent activities by analyzing large datasets and recognizing patterns that indicate potential fraud

* **Solution:** AI models learn from trends and can highlight suspicious attributes or relationships that may not be visible to a human analyst, but indicate a larger pattern of fraud.

## Type of Machine Learning Used:
* **Supervised Learning:** Incorporates prior knowledge of fraud tactics to guide pattern identification because it’s easy to teach the machine once there’s a clear target for it to learn.

* **Unsupervised Learning:** Used when guiding data for outcomes isn’t available. These anomaly detection models help pick up on unknown trends or aberrations in transactions, and predict smaller ‘pockets’ of information.

## Impact:
* **Pattern recognition:** AI and ML algorithms excel at recognizing complex patterns, data point interactions and anomalies in large datasets, enabling more accurate fraud detection.

* **Real-Time Detection:** Enables real-time identification and prevention of fraudulent transactions.
* **Adaptive learning:** ML algorithms can dynamically adapt to new fraud tactics through continuous learning, enhancing their effectiveness over time.

# Marketing - Advertisement Targeting

## Problem:
* **Challenge:** Understanding what's the most relevant advertisement to users. Which ad a specific user is most likely to engage with.  

* **Solution:** Machine learning models can segment customers based on behavior, preferences, and demographics to optimize marketing campaigns.

## Type of Machine Learning Used:
* **Supervised Learning** To predict which users are most likely to engage with an ad (e.g., clicking, purchasing).

* **Unsupervised Learning:** To optimize ad placement and bidding strategies in real-time, adapting to user interactions.

## Impact:
* **Personalized Marketing:** Increases the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by targeting the right audience with tailored messages.

* **Customer Satisfaction:** Enhances customer satisfaction by providing products and services that align with their needs.
